# The-Meals-App
This is my second learning project using React Native. You can view recipes for different meals of different categories. From Italian traditional food to hamburgers and German food. In this project, I use Redux for data storage, React Navigation for comfort navigating in-application, and other cool stuff. Definitely check and try on your own. Enjoy!
